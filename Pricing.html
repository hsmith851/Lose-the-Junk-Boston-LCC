<h2>How Pricing Works</h2>

<ol type="1">
  <li>ON SITE PRICING. The best and most accurate way for us to assess the job and 
      offer you the lowest price is free, no obligation on site estimate. 
      When we are on-site, we can see most exactly what the job will require. This helps us give you an immediate, accurate, and fair price for your junk removal job. When you're happy with the price, 
      in most cases we will complete the job right then and there.</li>
      <br/>
      <br/>
  <li>ONLINE PRICING ESTIMATE. For an online pricing estimate, simply click "Pricing" in the navigation above, scroll to pricing estimator, enter a zip code, and choose estimate by items or volume. The online price estimator is based on the average size of a typical item and the price in your local market. The size of a couch or a TV or any item may vary, which will affect your price. The online estimator provides an estimate only. 
      Our goal with the estimator is to give you a solid idea of what the job is likely to cost.</li>

<br/>
  <li>TEXT US A PHOTO. If you can take a photo of your items, text us at (781) 686-3449 and we will text you back an estimate. If your items are in different locations on your property, you can send us multiple photos and we will be able to provide you with an estimate. 
      Please note an estimate is not a firm price.</li>
      <br/>
<br/>
  <li>CALL & TALK TO TRAINED STAFF. Finally, you can call and/or live chat our customer service representatives. We are open from 4:45a - 8p PST, 7:45a - 11p EST, 6 days a week, and for 8 hours on Sunday. If you have 4 items or less, in many cases we will be able to offer you a firm price. If you have 4 items or more, we can offer you an estimate range at the call center. </li>
